                <h3>The Road Not Taken</h3>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</p>
                    <p>And sorry I could not travel both</p>
                    <p>And be one traveler, long I stood</p>
                    <p>And looked down one as far as I could</p>
                    <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then took the other, as just as fair,</p>
                    <p>And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
                    <p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
                    <p>Though as for that the passing there</p>
                    <p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And both that morning equally lay</p>
                    <p>In leaves no step had trodden black.</p>
                    <p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
                    <p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p>
                    <p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
                    <p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p>
                    <p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—</p>
                    <p>I took the one less traveled by,</p>
                    <p>And that has made all the difference.</p>

                <h3>Hope</h3>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>"Hope" is the thing with feathers -</p>
                    <p>That perches in the soul -</p>
                    <p>And sings the tune without the words -</p>
                    <p>And never stops - at all -</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -</p>
                    <p>And sore must be the storm -</p>
                    <p>That could abash the little Bird</p>
                    <p>That kept so many warm -</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I've heard it in the chillest land -</p>
                    <p>And on the strangest Sea -</p>
                    <p>Yet - never - in Extremity,</p>
                    <p>It asked a crumb - of me.</p>

                <h3>Still I Rise</h3>
                <div class="poem-content">
                    <p>You may write me down in history</p>
                    <p>With your bitter, twisted lies,</p>
                    <p>You may trod me in the very dirt</p>
                    <p>But still, like dust, I'll rise.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Does my sassiness upset you?</p>
                    <p>Why are you beset with gloom?</p>
                    <p>'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells</p>
                    <p>Pumping in my living room.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Just like moons and like suns,</p>
                    <p>With the certainty of tides,</p>
                    <p>Just like hopes springing high,</p>
                    <p>Still I'll rise.</p>
